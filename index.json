[{"content":"A couple of weeks ago, I saw this Short Circuit on this really cool camera: Basically, it\u0026rsquo;s a camera that can shoot in 4k and can track you around the room so you never have to adjust it. It also has smart features like gesture detection and a whiteboard mode, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to fiddle around with getting the focus right or getting a whiteboard in frame. And, any settings that you change on it are saved directly on the camera, so the lack of the Insta360 software on Linux isn\u0026rsquo;t as bad! Seems like an easy purchase! 300 beans? I\u0026rsquo;m good. This got me thinking of how to get a webcam for my stream, and so I got to thinking about how to I could use the only camera I have available to me - my phone. I did some googling and I found DroidCam OBS, a really simple app that pipes the camera output from your phone straight to OBS. Just enable USB Debugging, plug it in, and it pops up in OBS! It just works! I bought the premium version right away because paying for open-source software is something that needs to happen more often. For as good as the software is though, it can\u0026rsquo;t fix the fact that my phone was always getting my bad angle since it had to be resting on my desk. So, I started to think of a mount that I could 3D print so I could look better to my 2-3 viewers.\nI came up with these drafts so I could start modeling it in freecad:\nThis is a work in progress.
